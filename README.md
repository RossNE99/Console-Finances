# Console-Finances 📈💵

## Description
This repository contains the code for my Console Finances web app. The goal of this project revolves around handling a pre-existing dataset and performing essential calculations, with the results neatly displayed in the console.

This web app calculates the following from a given dataset;
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

The driving force behind this endeavor was to simulate a real-world scenario, fostering a comprehensive understanding not only of the code structure but also of the intricate calculations involved. Despite the dataset being available in its raw format, manually crunching these numbers would have been tedious and error-prone. To overcome this challenge, I've developed a JavaScript application that automates the iteration through the dataset array, executing diverse calculations and showcasing the results in the console. This streamlined approach not only saves time but also ensures a more accurate and reliable solution, making it an ideal tool for financial analysis tasks. Feel free to explore and leverage this repository for your own financial data analysis projects.
